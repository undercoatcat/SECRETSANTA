        <p>
            You seem to have wandered into a strange place on the internet…<br>
            Don't worry, you're not lost.<br>
            Probably.
        </p>

        <p>
            This place holds a clue… or maybe it's just here to confuse you further.<br>
            Who knows? Certainly not me.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's but one thing I can tell you<br>
            My sweet summer child<br>
            If you are reading this<br>
            You will reach the end<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Look around. Something here might guide you forward.
            Or maybe it won't.<br>
            I hope you <strong>proceed</strong>.<br>
            Good luck.
        </p>
